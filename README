# Kubernetes Cluster Setup using kubeadm (Master & Worker)

This repository provides **automated shell scripts** to set up a **Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm** on Ubuntu systems.

The setup follows **official Kubernetes best practices**, using:

* **containerd** as the Kubernetes container runtime
* **Docker** for developer convenience (image building, debugging, CI/CD)

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04
* Minimum 2 CPUs (Master)
* At least 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended for Master)
* Passwordless `sudo` access
* Internet connectivity

---

## 🧱 Architecture

* **1 Master Node**
* **1 or more Worker Nodes**
* Runtime: **containerd**
* Kubernetes version: **v1.29**

---

## 🚀 Master Node Setup

Run the following commands **on the Master node**:

```bash
sudo -i
chmod +x k8s-master.sh
./k8s-master.sh
```

### Initialize the Kubernetes control plane:

```bash
kubeadm init
```

> Save the `kubeadm join` command printed at the end — it is required for worker nodes.

---

## 🚀 Worker Node Setup

Run the following commands **on each Worker node**:

```bash
sudo -i
chmod +x k8s-worker.sh
./k8s-worker.sh
```

### Join the worker node to the cluster:

```bash
kubeadm join <MASTER-IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
```

## 🐳 Why Docker is Installed?

Kubernetes **does NOT require Docker** as a runtime anymore.

* Kubernetes uses **containerd**
* Docker is installed **only for**:

  * Image building
  * Debugging containers
  * CI/CD workflows
  * Developer convenience

This follows **modern Kubernetes standards**.

---

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

* Swap disabled (mandatory for Kubernetes)
* Required kernel modules loaded
* Proper sysctl configuration
* Kubernetes components version locked
* Services enabled on boot

---

## 📌 Next Recommended Steps

After cluster setup:

* Install a **CNI plugin** (e.g., Calico)
* Configure `kubectl` for non-root user
* Add monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
* Enable HPA and NetworkPolicies

---

## ✅ Summary

✔ Fully automated installation
✔ Separate Master & Worker scripts
✔ Production & interview ready
✔ Clean and reusable for real projects
